                <p>"You can win the rat race but you're still a rat.</p>
                <p>The human race is an unfair and stupid competition. A lot of the runners don't even get decent sneakers or clean drinking water.</p>
                <p>Some runners are born with a massive head start, every possible help along the way and still the referees seem to be on their side.</p>
                <p>It's not surprising a lot of people have given up competing altogether and gone to sit in the grandstand, eat junk food and shout abuse.</p>
                <p>What we need in this race is a lot more streakers." - Banksy</p>
